 ## 1. Python:
 Revised the most important language for data science.
- **Hello, Python**: A quick introduction to Python syntax, variable assignment, and numbers
- **Functions and Getting Help**: Calling functions and defining our own, and using Python's builtin documentation
- **Booleans and Conditionals**: Using booleans for branching logic
- **Lists**: Lists and the things you can do with them. Includes indexing, slicing and mutating
- **Loops and List Comprehensions**: For and while loops, and a much-loved Python feature: list comprehensions
- **Strings and Dictionaries**: Working with strings and dictionaries, two fundamental Python data types
- **Certification**: *https://www.kaggle.com/learn/certification/worldofsaad/python*


## 2. Intro to Machine Learning:
Revising the core ideas in machine learning, and building models.
- **Basic Data Exploration**: Load and understand your data
- **Your First Machine Learning Model**: Building your first model. Hurray!
- **Model Validation**: Measure the performance of your model ? so you can test and compare alternatives
- **Underfitting and Overfitting**: Fine-tune your model for better performance.
- **Random Forests**: Using a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm.
- **Exercise: Machine Learning Competitions**: Enter the world of machine learning competitions to keep improving and see your progress
- **Getting Started With Titanic**: Create your own Kaggle Notebooks to organize your work in competitions.

## 3. Intermediate Machine Learning
Learn to handle missing values, non-numeric values, data leakage and more. Your models will be more accurate and useful.
- **Missing Values**: Missing values happen. Be prepared for this common challenge in real datasets.
- **Categorical Variables**: There's a lot of non-numeric data out there. Here's how to use it for machine learning
- **Pipelines**: A critical skill for deploying (and even testing) complex models with pre-processing
- **Cross-Validation**: A better way to test your models
- **XGBoost**: The most accurate modeling technique for structured data
- **Data Leakage**: Find and fix this problem that ruins your model in subtle ways

## 4. Data Visualization
Make great data visualizations. A great way to see the power of coding!
- **Hello, Seaborn**: Your first introduction to coding for data visualization
- **Line Charts**: Visualize trends over time
- **Bar Charts and Heatmaps**: Use color or length to compare categories in a dataset
- **Scatter Plot**: Leverage the coordinate plane to explore relationships between variables
- **Distributions**: Create histograms and density plots
